# CPP

With this project I learned C++ language. This project included 9 smaller projects. I discovered new concepts step-by-step. The exercises progressively increased in complexity.

What I learned in each smaller project:

00 - Namespaces, classes, member functions, stdio streams, initialization lists, static, const, and some other basic stuf.

01 - Memory allocation, pointers to members, references, switch statement.

02 - Ad-hoc polymorphism, operator overloading and Orthodox Canonical class form.

03 - Inheritance.

04 - Subtype polymorphism, abstract classes, interfaces.

05 - Repetition and Exceptions.

06 - C++ casts.

07 - C++ templates.

08 - Templated containers, iterators, algorithms.
